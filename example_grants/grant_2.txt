APPLICATION TO THE NORTHERN WELLBEING TRUST
Grant Award: £15,000
Date: March 2024

ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND (300 words)

Jeremy's Wonderful Smile Charity (JWSC) is a registered community organization founded in 2019, operating across the Greater Manchester region with a focus on emotional wellbeing through human connection. Our founder, Jeremy Harrison, possesses what three independent smile assessment experts have verified as "an exceptionally lovely smile" (Smile Quality Index: 9.2/10).

Since inception, we have delivered 219,000 documented smiles to members of the public, with a measured happiness increase of 89% (self-reported surveys, n=847). Our operational model combines daily community engagement, emergency response services, and skills training, all centered on the scientifically-proven benefits of positive facial expressions on mental health outcomes.

Our organization employs one full-time Happiness Distribution Specialist (Jeremy) and coordinates three volunteer Documentation Officers who maintain our rigorous impact measurement systems. With an annual operating budget of £47,000, we maintain exceptionally low overhead costs (4% administrative) while reaching over 73,000 individuals annually through our core programs.

We serve Greater Manchester's most vulnerable populations: isolated elderly residents, individuals experiencing mental health crises, and young people struggling with social anxiety. Our unique strength lies in providing immediate, barrier-free emotional support - no referral required, no waiting lists, no cost to service users.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION (500 words)

This grant will fund expansion of our Smile Emergency Response (SER) service from 5 days/week to 7 days/week coverage. Currently, our hotline operates Monday-Friday 9am-5pm. Data analysis shows 34% of distress calls occur outside these hours, particularly weekends when isolation and loneliness peak and statutory mental health services are unavailable.

The expanded service will provide weekend emergency smile deployment (Saturday-Sunday, 10am-4pm) and pilot evening coverage (Thursday-Friday, 5pm-8pm) for working professionals unable to access support during business hours. This addresses a critical gap in community mental health provision.

Our emergency response protocol is proven effective: when someone experiencing acute emotional distress calls our hotline, Jeremy responds within an average of 58 minutes, traveling by bicycle to meet them in a public location. He provides 5-10 minutes of focused, genuine positive attention through his documented therapeutic smile. Follow-up surveys show 94% satisfaction, with 67% of recipients reporting the intervention prevented escalation of their crisis.

With expanded hours, we project serving an additional 120 individuals per year - people who currently have nowhere to turn during weekend mental health crises. We will acquire an electric bicycle to reduce response times from 58 minutes to target 35 minutes, critical when someone is in acute distress.

Budget breakdown: Electric bicycle (£2,800), Weekend volunteer coordinator stipend (£8,000/year), Mobile phone upgrade for better hotline reliability (£600), Reflective safety equipment for evening deployments (£400), Marketing materials to advertise expanded hours (£1,200), Contingency (£2,000). Total: £15,000.

The weekend coordinator will manage volunteer scheduling, maintain emergency supplies, and coordinate with local NHS crisis teams for seamless referral pathways. Evening service pilot will test demand from working professionals who cannot access support during business hours - a population currently underserved by existing provision.

IMPACT AND EVALUATION (300 words)

We will measure success through five quantifiable metrics. First, call volume tracking with a target of 120+ weekend calls in Year 1, demonstrating unmet demand. Second, response time monitoring with target average of under 35 minutes (down from current 58 minutes). Third, post-intervention satisfaction surveys administered 24 hours after each smile deployment, maintaining our current 94% satisfaction rate.

Fourth, we will track reduction in repeat emergency calls as an indicator of sustained impact - targeting 30% decrease in individuals requiring multiple interventions, suggesting our service provides lasting benefit. Fifth, cost-efficiency analysis calculating cost-per-smile-deployment, with target of under £95 per intervention (significantly lower than traditional crisis services averaging £400+).

Our existing data demonstrates strong outcomes: independent evaluation by Manchester Metropolitan University's Wellbeing Research Centre confirmed our methodology meets academic standards for emotional support interventions. Average happiness duration post-smile is 45 minutes, with 23% of recipients reporting "life-changing" long-term impact in 6-month follow-ups.

The expanded weekend service addresses a documented gap in mental health provision. Local NHS crisis teams report Saturday-Sunday as highest-demand periods, yet community support services are largely unavailable. Our immediate, accessible intervention model provides crucial early support that prevents crisis escalation and reduces burden on emergency services.

Quarterly evaluation reports will be submitted to the funder, with final impact assessment at 12 months including case studies, statistical analysis, and recommendations for permanent service implementation.

SUSTAINABILITY (200 words)

This grant provides 12-month funding to pilot expanded service and demonstrate weekend demand. After Year 1, we will pursue three sustainability strategies. First, applications to three additional local funders (Tudor Trust, Lloyds Bank Foundation, Co-op Community Fund) based on demonstrated weekend service data - our track record shows 78% grant success rate.

Second, development of corporate sponsorship program targeting four local businesses for £2,000 annual commitments (£8,000 total). We have preliminary interest from two Manchester companies seeking authentic community partnerships. Third, launch of "Sponsor a Smile" individual donor scheme recruiting 80 monthly donors at £10/month, generating £9,600 annually.

Our core 5-day service demonstrates financial sustainability with diverse income streams: 48% individual donations, 31% earned income from private smile deployments at weddings and corporate events, 21% grant funding. Weekend expansion requires initial investment but projected demand (120+ annual users) justifies permanent service within 24 months based on our financial modeling.

We have identified potential local authority contract opportunities for weekend wellbeing coverage, with Manchester City Council expressing interest in pilot partnership for 2025-26.
