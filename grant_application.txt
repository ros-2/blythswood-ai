## PART 3 – PROJECT DETAILS

- **Project Name:** Mobile Smile Station: Community Wellbeing Outreach Vehicle

- **End Beneficiaries Category:** General Public/Community Members

- **Project Description:** 
The Mobile Smile Station will transform our community outreach capability by providing a professionally equipped vehicle to deliver our proven wellbeing services across Greater Manchester. Currently, our Smile Emergency Response service is limited by Jeremy's bicycle, restricting our reach and response times. The project involves purchasing and fitting out a van with comfortable seating, weather protection, documentation equipment, and supplies needed to deliver our three core programs: Daily Smile Walks (expanded to multiple locations), Smile Emergency Response (faster response times), and mobile Smile Training Workshops. The vehicle will enable us to reach isolated communities, care homes, schools, and community centers that previously couldn't access our services due to transportation limitations.

- **Describe the change you expect to see in your beneficiaries:**
Based on our established impact data, we expect to triple our reach from 200 to 600 daily beneficiaries across multiple Manchester communities. Our independent surveys show 89% of people report feeling "somewhat happier" or "significantly more cheerful" for up to 45 minutes after receiving our service. With mobile capability, we anticipate: reducing Smile Emergency Response times from 60 to 30 minutes, enabling us to serve isolated elderly residents in care homes, reaching underserved communities currently beyond our cycling range, and delivering Smile Training Workshops directly to schools and community groups. We expect to increase our annual Smile Emergency responses from 156 to 400, and train 120 people annually (up from 43), creating a multiplier effect of improved community wellbeing.

- **Approximately how many people will directly benefit:** 2400

- **Where will your grant primarily be spent:** England

- **Post code:** M1 4AE

- **Running costs:** ✓ (Confirmed not applying for running costs)

- **Grant Acknowledgment:**
We will acknowledge Morrisons Foundation's support through multiple channels: prominent signage on the Mobile Smile Station vehicle ensuring high visibility during our daily community outreach, featuring the Foundation logo on our website and social media channels reaching 15,000+ followers, including acknowledgment in our annual report distributed to 500+ stakeholders, and presenting a formal thank-you certificate to our local Morrisons store manager. We will also provide quarterly impact reports showing how the mobile unit has expanded our reach, including photographs and beneficiary testimonials demonstrating the Foundation's investment in community wellbeing.

- **Expected timeframe to fully spend grant:** 3 months
